Company Xero is a worldwide e-commerce site with localized versions of the site. We noticed that Spain-based users have a much higher conversion rate than any other Spanish-speaking country.We hypothesized that one reason could be translation. All Spanish speaking
countries had the same translation of the site which was written by a Spaniard. We agreed to try a test where each country would have its one translation written by a local. That is,Argentinian users would see a translation written by an Argentinian, Mexican users by a Mexican
and so on. Obviously, nothing would change for users from Spain.

Here, we made a hypothsis that the local translation treatment will increase the conversion rate.

In this task, I am going to analyze whether the effect of localized-translation is working and interpret the results based on the analysis.
